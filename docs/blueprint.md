# **App Name**: CS-One Platform

## Core Features:

- Merge Duplicate Profiles: Allow admin users to find and merge duplicate customer profiles. All interaction history, notes, and order data are consolidated into a single master profile, while the duplicate records are archived. This ensures data integrity and a single source of truth.
- Ticket Management System: Introduces a centralized system to formally track customer issues from creation to resolution. Agents can create tickets, assign ownership, update statuses (e.g., New, In-Progress, Resolved), and log all related interactions (calls, chats) within the ticket. This ensures no issue is ever lost and provides managers with clear metrics on resolution times and team performance.
- Link & Unlink Identity: Enables to link customer accounts across multiple channels (Facebook, Zalo, Phone) to the master profile. It also provides a simple way to unlink or relink identities in case of errors, ensuring data accuracy is maintained.
- Screen Pop: Display a pop-up window with caller information when a call is received, fetching data from the master profile and offering quick access. For unrecognized numbers, a 'New Profile' option is available.
- Call Summarization: Automatically summarize the content of recorded calls. LLM tool identifies key topics discussed and sentiment expressed, and then extracts relevant highlights from the phone conversation and logs them to the system.
- Widget Integration: Integrates a smart widget directly into the Pancake chat interface. When a conversation starts, the widget automatically displays the customer's key information (name, phone, recent orders), eliminating the need for manual searches and providing immediate context.
- Unified 360Â° View: Provides a comprehensive, timeline-based view of every customer on a dedicated web interface. This includes personal details, a complete history of all interactions across all channels, full order history, and specialized data like eye measurement details.
- Call Recording & Logging: Automatically records all inbound and outbound calls. These recordings are logged and attached directly to the customer's interaction timeline, making it easy for managers to review for quality assurance or to resolve disputes.
